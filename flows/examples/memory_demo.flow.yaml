# This workflow demonstrates BeemFlow's organizational memory feature
# Each run can access outputs from the previous run of the same workflow

        This workflow maintains conversation continuity across runs.
        Each execution can reference outputs from the previous run.
        No external storage needed - it's all in BeemFlow's runtime!
        
        Try running this workflow multiple times to see the memory in action.
